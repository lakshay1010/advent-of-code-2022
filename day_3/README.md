Till this problem, I was trying to solve the problem while reading the input from the file.
Without storing the input. It saves space but leads to terrible code. So, now on I'll try to

- read input seperately, in a cleaner manner
- store the input
- write functions for solution
- pass stored input to functions

I will also try to use modern (BUT NOT TOO MODERN) c++ features in the code.
